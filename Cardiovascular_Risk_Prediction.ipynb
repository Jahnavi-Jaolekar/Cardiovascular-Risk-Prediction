This score helps to understand if a data value is greater or smaller than mean and how far away it is from the mean. More specifically, Z score tells how many standard deviations away a data point is from the mean. We are not supposed to remove all the outliers as we can see from the above boxplots that we have a lot of outliers in few of the columns but we cannot remove or replace as high values of BMI, BP, etc show that patient has high risk of cardivascular disease, if we remove these values we might get false results during model predictions. but few vlues wivh were baseless such as BMI value of 0 has to be removed. so in the above charts we have removed irrelevant outliers."

        "Answer Here -  It is obvious that the classes are unbalanced, which would cause the model to be more biassed in favour of the \"0\" class (people with no Risk of CHD). We must discover a method for training a model such that it may accept some risk and provide more results in the \"1\" class.\n",
        "\n",
        "We need to create a model that can forecast the risk of CHD, which is the rationale behind that. The model need to be able to foretell the risk of heart disease if there is even a remote possibility, given the patient's health statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in a real-world scenario, our model is more beneficial because it is extremely likely that such a model will be able to anticipate whether a patient is at danger. Certainly, this would cause our model to reach a lower accuracy score since it is taking more risks for \"at risk\" patients.\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical technique would have improved our accuracy in this case due to the class imbalance, but in the real world, such a model isn't an acceptable answer because it's predicted that it will frequently fail to determine whether the patient is at risk, defeating the goal of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, we are using SMOTETomek on the training set to address these imbalances. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, or SMOTE for short, is a type of data augmentation for the minority class. The strategy works because it generates convincing new synthetic examples from the minority class that are substantially near in feature space to already existing examples from the minority class.."
